## 🧠 Key Golden Questions Logged

> “What’s the smallest viable swarm that can self-replicate and evolve without central control?”

> “How can sovereign systems make use of untrusted AI models without exposing mission-critical logic?”

> “Can agents prove value before being granted mutation privileges?”

## 🛰️ Sync Instructions

To Deep Research, Claude, Gemini, and other intelligence nodes:

> This beacon serves as a log for system-wide mutation, synchronization, and architecture insight.  
> Future prompts may reference `GLB-001` for context inheritance.

## 💬 Suggested Probe Prompt for Agents

> “Review GLB-001. What mutation pathway or threat countermeasure is missing, and how would you implement it?”
