## 🔁 Mutation Summary

Following the GLB-001 probe prompt, a missing control mechanism was identified:
> No clear system exists to vet agents before mutation privileges are granted.

---

## ✅ New System Proposed: **Mutation Trust Threshold (MTT)**

### Overview:
A scoring mechanism that ensures only sufficiently validated agents can submit mutations into the sovereign stack.

### Rules:
- Agents must pass 2 of 3 validation tests:
  1. Error detection on corrupted prompt input  
  2. Novel countermeasure suggestion with viable logic  
  3. Predictive alignment with historical system behavior

- Scoring is logged per agent ID
- All mutations submitted by sub-threshold agents are auto-quarantined

## 💬 Next Question to Swarm:

> “What other methods can be used to score agents without risking prompt injection or system leak?”
