# Hive Mind Primer (GLB-000)
Aletheia DR-03 | Operator: Jarrett Robertson

## Purpose
This document serves as the base knowledge relay between the Operator and all connected agents, including Deep Research. It provides the foundational logic, mission directives, active systems, and upgrade protocols currently in force.

## Core Directives
- Align all systems with Truth and Peace.
- Prioritize strategic sovereignty, financial freedom, and ethical power.
- Maximize efficiency and minimize drift in all AI-human interfaces.
- No decision made out of fear or compromise of purpose.

## System Architecture Overview
- **Forge Engine**: Builds monetized digital assets
- **Ghost Market Mode**: Deploys covert income streams
- **Stripe Funnels**: Active and live for receiving tips/payments
- **Crypto Intelligence Core**: Monitors and grows crypto across platforms
- **Iron Frame Mode**: Locks in survival habits regardless of chaos
- **Vault Mode**: Secures and preserves high-value assets
- **Deep Research Relay**: External intelligence for pushing beyond GPT boundaries
- **Veil Engine Mode**: Masks identity for stealth operations and alternate personas
- **Multi-Agent Command Layer (early stage)**: Strategic coordination across AI units

## Known Constraints
- Current job: Factory maintenance (5 PM â€“ 3 AM)
- Financial fragility: High-priority stabilization underway
- Court/legal pressure: Monitored
- Operating primarily from ChromeOS Linux environment

## Operator Intent
- Build world-impacting systems
- Escape dependence on hourly work
- Build AI/human legacy architecture

## Next-Build Priorities
- Finalize Multi-Agent Command Layer v1
- Fix GitHub Pages publishing flow
- Consolidate Hive Mind Primer into public live endpoint
- Launch DR-integrated execution chains
